      <p className="mb-4">
        At <strong>Abeg Fix</strong>, our platform connects users with service professionals.
        We do not directly provide the services listed, and we do not process
        payments between customers and artisans. Therefore, refunds for services
        rendered must be handled directly between the customer and the artisan.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Platform Fees</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Any fees paid to Abeg Fix for upgraded features (such as profile
        boosting, advertising, or premium listings) are <strong>non-refundable</strong> once
        activated.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">User Responsibilities</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Before hiring an artisan, users are responsible for:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>Reviewing artisan profiles and ratings</li>
        <li>Verifying identity and qualifications if necessary</li>
        <li>Agreeing on pricing and job scope before work begins</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Refunds from Artisans</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If a dispute occurs regarding service quality or payment, refunds must be
        requested directly from the artisan. Abeg Fix may assist by sharing
        communication records but is not responsible for refund enforcement.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Subscriptions & Promotional Services</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Payments for promotional tools or subscription features are final and
        cannot be refunded once the service period begins.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Cancellation Policy</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Users may stop using the platform at any time. Cancellation of premium
        plans does not grant a refund for unused time.
      </p>
